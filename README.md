This is a repository containing MATLAB codes for the paper entitled, "Cluster-based feedback control of turbulent post-stall separated flows", JFM, 2019. Please cite this work when using the codes.

Codes: main_CBC.m : Computes cluster-centroids using aerodynamic trajectories and deduces optimal cluster-based control laws.

To run this code, a Navier-Stokes solver is needed (run_Navier_Stokes) in CBC.m.
